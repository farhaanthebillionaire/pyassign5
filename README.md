# 🐍 Python Practice: Dictionary and List Slicing

This project includes two basic Python tasks to practice working with dictionaries and list slicing. Both are simple but important concepts for beginners.


## 📘 Task 1: Student Marks Lookup (Using Dictionary)

### 🎯 Goal
To create a program that:
- Stores a list of students and their marks.
- Asks the user to input a student's name.
- Shows the marks if the student is found.
- Displays a message if the student is not in the records.

### 💡 What You Learn
- How to use dictionaries in Python.
- How to take user input.
- How to search for a key in a dictionary.
- How to display values based on user input.


## 📗 Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing and Reversing

### 🎯 Goal
To work with list slicing by:
- Creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extracting the first 5 numbers from the list.
- Reversing those 5 numbers.
- Printing all three: the original list, the extracted part, and the reversed part.

### 💡 What You Learn
- How to create lists using `range`.
- How list slicing works (`start:stop`).
- How to reverse a list using negative step slicing (`[::-1]`).
- How to print and understand list outputs.


## 📥 How to Use

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Run `task1.py` to search for student marks.
3. Run `task2.py` to see list slicing and reversing in action.

Use any terminal or Python IDE (like VS Code, PyCharm, or Thonny) to run these scripts.


## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x installed
- Basic understanding of variables, lists, dictionaries, and input/output

## 📎 Summary

These two tasks help beginners practice:
- Handling data with dictionaries
- Manipulating and slicing lists
- Interacting with users using input
